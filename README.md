aria-describedby="customer-error": This establishes a relationship between the select element and the error message container. It indicates that the container with id="customer-error" describes the select element. Screen readers will read this description when the user interacts with the select box to notify them of errors.

id="customer-error": This id attribute uniquely identifies the HTML element that holds the error message for the select input. This is necessary for aria-describedby to establish the relationship.

aria-live="polite": The screen reader should politely notify the user when the error inside the div is updated. When the content changes (e.g. when a user corrects an error), the screen reader will announce these changes, but only when the user is idle so as not to interrupt them.
